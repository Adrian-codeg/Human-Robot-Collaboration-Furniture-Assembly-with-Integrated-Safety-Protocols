# Human-Robot-Collaboration-Furniture-Assembly-with-Integrated-Safety-Protocols
This project explores the use of collaborative robots (cobots) in the furniture assembly industry, with a focus on safety, perception, and task automation. It combines literature review, system design, and simulation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Objectives:

- Simulated collaborative robot workflows for pick-and-place tasks:

- Task 1: Detect and capture a peg using 3D point cloud processing, then apply path planning to insert it into a designated hole.

- Task 2: Assemble an IKEA chair from randomly positioned components, executing sequential pick-and-place operations to build the final structure.

- Integrated real-time safety monitoring and control protocols into collaborative assembly operations.

- Evaluated system performance based on task duration, accuracy, safety compliance, and collaboration quality.
